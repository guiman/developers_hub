Hi, I'm Alvaro from Developer's Hub, an application that aims to make dev recruitment
better. There is a recruiter that is interested in contacting you for a job opportunity.

We haven't given any contact details and we are forwarding their message to you for your consideration.

Here is the message you have received from <%= @developer.viewer.name %>:


<%= @body %>

----------------------------------
If this opportunity is interesting for you, only hit reply on the email (we have added the recruiter).
----------------------------------
For more information about the site, visit http://www.dev-hub.io
Also, if you wish to stop receiving this emails, please update your status to
not available for hire in Github and sing in (this updates our records).
We won't bother you any more :)

Thank you!
